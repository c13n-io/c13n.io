      <description>What is c13n Sitting on top of Bitcoin &amp;amp; LightningNetwork layer, c13n is a component that makes your interaction with LN much easier. It acts as an intermediate layer between your application and your LN Node, without introducing any centralization characteristics.
c13n utilizes the node&amp;rsquo;s interface to achieve a higher-level API, easy for devs to get used to and to start building on top of right away.
One of the main priorities of c13n is to be based as much as possible on Lightning Network communication (through micro-payments), and to utilize clearnet the least possible.</description>
